###
This object acts as a bridge between the unpersisted nature of JavaScript and
the expectations of users, that their choices are still applied after a reload
or HTTP request:

- When a user reloads the page, he expects to be where he was before. To
  accomplish that, we update the history when parameters change.
- Certain things like the selected location are required to be kept even longer.
  We set cookies for that. (Happens in Location Micro-App)
- When a user presses the search button, he issues a new HTML request and the
  data inside JS is lost. Thus when search parameters change, search form fields
  need to be updated.
- The above also implies, that we need to load the initial state of the JS
  search parameters from the form. (RoR will take care of syncing the form
  contents to the URL parameters.)

Think of it as the database, that the model interacts with.

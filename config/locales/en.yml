          answer: "On clarat you can find support for children, teenagers and families of all sexual orientations. \nThat means there's support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people. \nHowever, we want our descriptions to be short and easy to understand. \nSo we can’t always list all of these terms.That’s why we use the abbreviation LGBTI."
          question: Why does clarat use the abbreviation <i>LGBTI</i>?
        question_5:
          answer: "At clarat we use simple language. That’s why we use words that are easy to \nunderstand. Words that many people know and use.

        question_2:
          answer: |-
            You can select your language at the top of the page. Google Translate
            will then automatically translate everything into your language. Since
            it’s an automatic translation, there might be a few mistakes. The
            translation might sound a bit strange sometimes.
          question: How can I use clarat in my language?
        question_3:
          answer: |-
            Google Translate generates automatic translations. This is why there
            might be a few mistakes. This means that the translation might not
            always be entirely correct.
          question: Why do the texts sound so strange in my language?
      section_5:
        heading: Do you have questions regarding your organization?
        question_1:
          answer: "Your organization provides help for children, teenagers and families.\nThat’s why we’ve included your support services on <b>clarat family</b>. \nWe want to people who need your support as quickly and easily as possible.\n<br>\nOr perhaps your organization’s support services provide help for refugees \nwho have fled to Germany. That’s why we’ve included your services on <b>clarat\nrefugees</b>. We want to give refugees quick and simple information about\nwhere they can find the help they need."
          question: Why are my organization’s support services listed on clarat?
        question_2:
          answer: "<b>clarat family</b> helps children, teenagers and families find your\norganization’s support services. <b>clarat refugees</b> helps refugees \nfind the support they need. Your organization’s support programmes can \nonly be found if people know about your organization. To make sure that \neverybody really understands the kind of help your organization provides, \nwe explain everything in clear, simple language. What's more, all the \nsupport services can be automatically translated into a variety of languages, \ntoo."
          question: What does clarat do for my organization?
        question_3:
          answer: |-
            You can enter the name of your organization in the search field where it
            says <b>What?</b>. And your location in the search field that says
            <b>Where?</b> Then you'll be shown a list of support services provided in

          question: How can I find my organization’s support services on clarat?
        question_4:
          answer: "All the support services on clarat are described in simple language \nso that everyone can find help as easily as possible. Using simple language \nmeans that complicated things sometimes need to be explained in a simple way. \nSome ideas need to be simplified. Doing this ensures that the automatic\ntranslation is much better. If you think that something should be\nexplained differently, please let us know. You can send an e-mail to\n%{mailto_clarat}."

          question: Why are the descriptions of our support services on clarat so different  from the ones we have on our website?
        question_5:
          answer: "We want to help people find help as easily as possible.\nThis is why we've split up your organization’s support services so that\nthere is just one service for each specific problem. That way people \nlooking for help can find exactly the help they need."
          question: My organization offers just one support service. But on the clarat page this one service is listed as many. Why?
        question_6:
          answer: "In Germany, there are a lot of different support services for children, \nteenagers, families and refugees. But clarat is still under construction. \nSo it's possible that we haven't been able to include all of your organization’s \nsupport programmes on clarat yet.

            There are two possible reasons for this:
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            It could be that we haven’t started compiling information about
            offerings at your organization’s location. clarat is being developed
            gradually. It is thus possible that we haven’t had a chance to include
            your organization yet.

            <li>
            It is also possible that your organization’s offerings don’t match our
            criteria. clarat only includes offerings on very specific topics. You
            can find out what those topics are %{ref_to_who_finds_help}. If you want

            Our website clarat.org is just getting started. You can already find
            many support services and programmes in Berlin. Soon we will be collecting support services for other
            cities as well. And we appreciate your help: is there anything you think we could do better?
            Or is something not working? Simply
        send: 
        unavailable_location_modal: At the moment, we only have telephone or online support services for your current location. That means you can get help over the telephone. Or online. For example, via e-mail or over chat. We will let you know as soon as there are support services near you. Please enter your e-mail address here.

        clarat ist a project financed by the charitable Benckiser Foundation
        (www.benckiser-stiftung.org). With the Benckiser Foundation, we have
        been supporting effective projects in the area of child and youth
        welfare for many years. In our work we kept noticing that it can be very
        difficult to find out what kind of help is out there. And then we realized:
        if even we, the “experts”, can’t get an overview of the help
        available out there, how difficult must it be for children, teenagers,
        and their families who are in actual need of help? Or for refugees who
        don’t know their way around yet? The answer: very difficult! And that's
        how the idea for clarat came about: helping people find help easily. For families on
        clarat family. And for refugees on clarat refugees.

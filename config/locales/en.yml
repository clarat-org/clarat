          answer: |
            clarat is an online platform where you can find help and support
            offerings. We help you find the help you need. We do not offer advising
            or consulting services – there are experts for that. And it is precisely
            their offerings that you will find on clarat: on <b>clarat
            family</b> and on <b>clarat refugees</b>:
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <b>clarat family</b> helps children, adolescents, and families, who are
            facing problems and who are looking for help nearby. Here you can easily
            find help for yourself, your family, and your friends, or for other
            children, adolescents, and families you might know. If you want to
            better understand what clarat family is all about, you can watch this
            short %{link_to_family_movie}.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>clarat refugees</b> helps refugees who are looking for support
            nearby. You can easily find help here: for yourself, your family, and
            your friends. You can also find help if you are not a refugee yourself,
            but know refugees who need help.

          question: What is clarat?
        question_10:
          answer: |
            The money for <b>clarat family</b> and <b>clarat refugees</b> comes from
            the %{link_to_bsz}.

          question: Who finances clarat?
        question_11:
          answer: |
            <b>clarat family</b> and <b>clarat refugees</b> are meant to exist for a
            long time. The %{link_to_bsz} will finance both platforms for the long
            term. This means that you will also be able to find help on clarat in
            the years to come. For now, the offerings are mostly in Berlin, but we
            will start adding offerings from other cities and regions to clarat very
            soon.

        question_12:

            clarat’s programming code is open source. The link to our code can be
            found %{link_to_github}.

          question: Is clarat’s programming code open source?
        question_13:
          answer: |
            For the time being, clarat does not offer an interface to download and
            edit data. We may have an interface in the future, but this is not
            entirely certain. For now, we primarily compile and sort data. If you
            are interested in such an interface, %{link_to_contact_form}.

          question: Does clarat offer an interface to download and edit data?
        question_2:
          answer: |
            There are many help and support offerings available in Germany for
            people who really need help. However, these offerings can often be hard
            to find. On the one hand, this is because it can be hard to know exactly
            where to look for them. On the other hand, this is because the contact
            partners are not always clear. That is exactly what we want to change.
          question: Why does clarat exist?
        question_3:
          answer: |
            Enter a search term describing your problem. Then add the location. You
            will find matching help and support offerings in your area. You will
            also be shown the help you can get over the phone or online. Have a look
            %{ref_to_how_to_find_right_help} for information about how to find what
            you’re looking for. When you click on the title of an offering, we tell
            you what you need to do to obtain the help you need, for example whether
            you need to call or whether you can just go there.

          question: How does clarat work?
        question_4:
          answer: |
            clarat is and will stay free of charge. Anyone can search on <b>clarat
            family</b> for help and support for children, adolescents, and families
            for free. And anyone can search on <b>clarat refugees</b> for help for
            refugees for free.
          question: Is clarat free of charge?
        question_5:
          answer: |
            Searching on clarat is always anonymous. That means that no one at
            clarat will know your name or your address
          question: Can I search anonymously on clarat?
        question_6:
          answer: |
            We regularly check whether the information on clarat is still up-to-date.
            After all, this is the only way we can ensure that clarat is really
            helpful for children, adolescents, families, and refugees. If the
            information is outdated, then we will update it.
          question: Is the information on clarat up to-date?
        question_7:
          answer: |
            Some of the offerings found on <b>clarat family</b> and <b>clarat
            refugees</b> can be accessed wherever you are. There are many offerings
            that allow you to receive help over the phone or online, for example
            via e-mail, via chat, or in an online forum. On <b>clarat refugees</b>
            you can find offerings for all of Germany. On <b>clarat family</b> you
            can find a large selection of offerings for Berlin, but we will soon
            start compiling information for other larger cities in Germany.
          question: Is clarat available for all of Germany?
        question_8:
          answer: |
            clarat shows you an overview of help and support offerings in your area,
            meaning all in one place. We also tell you exactly what you need to do
            to get help. We always use simple language that anyone can easily
            understand. This is because at clarat we want everyone to find the help
            they need – no matter how well they speak German. On clarat, you can
            also switch to other languages. If you want to know more, click

          question: What is special about clarat?
        question_9:
          answer: |
            clarat is a project of the %{link_to_bsz}, which is a family foundation
            with a long history of supporting children and adolescents. Now it wants
            to help refugees as well. Watch this %{link_to_bsz_movie} to learn more
            about the foundation. The idea for clarat was conceived in mid-2014, and
            the clarat team got started in September 2014. If you want to know more
            about us, have a look %{link_to_about_us}.

        question_1:
          anchor: who_finds_help
          answer: |
            clarat is for everyone: With only one click you can decide whether you
            want to search on <b>clarat family</b> or <b>clarat refugees</b>:
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <b>clarat family</b> is for children, adolescents, and families in need
            of help – regardless of whether they have problems in their families,
            with friends, at school, or somewhere else.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>clarat refugees</b> is for all refugees in Germany: for children and
            adolescents, for men and women, and for families, who have fled their
            home countries and are now in need of assistance.
            </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            clarat can also be useful for people who want to help others, such as
            teachers, neighbors, and friends.
          question: Who can find help on clarat?
        question_10:
          answer: |
            There could be several reasons for this.
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            It could be that your search term can’t be found. In that case, you
            should try another search with a different term. If you can’t think of
            another term, try searching by clicking on our icons. On clarat that
            means: <i>search by categories</i>. You can read about it
            %{ref_to_how_to_find_right_help}.
            </li>
            <li>
            If you live in a rural area and can’t seem to find any offerings nearby,
            enter the name of the nearest city in the search box that says
            <b>Where?</b> Or try searching for help offered via telephone or online.
            </li>
            <li>
            Another reason could be that we haven’t yet compiled any information on
            offerings in your district or city.
            </li>
            <li>
            Or we don’t yet have any matching offerings in our database. In order
            for us to change that, we need your feedback. If you can’t find what
            you’re looking for, please send an e-mail to %{mailto_clarat}.

          question: Why can’t I find what I’m looking for?
        question_11:
          answer: |
            First, you should check what kind of problem the offering addresses. You
            can find information in the description under <b>What’s it about?</b> If
            you don’t think that an offering provides the right kind of help for
            you, try a different one. If you’re still not sure, try contacting the
            organization. Usually there’s a number you can call or an e-mail address.
            You can find these contact details under <i>How can you get in touch?</i>
          question: What can I do if I don’t know whether a help or support offering is right for me?
        question_12:
          answer: |
            On clarat you can also look for help and support offerings for others,
            for example for a friend, as an uncle for your nephew, as a mother for
            your child, or as a teacher for your student. However, in our
            descriptions we usually address the person who will be receiving the
            help (usually children and adolescents).
          question: How do I find help if I’m not looking for myself, but for someone else?
        question_2:
          answer: |

            Here you can find support if you are in urgent need of help. If an
            offering’s title says <b>day and night</b> that means you can reach
            someone at any time – no matter how late it is.

          question: On what topics can I find help on clarat refugees?
        question_4:
          answer: |
            On the right side of the main page you will see a flash (lightning bolt)
            symbol. If you click on the flash you will see help and support
            offerings for emergency situations, meaning if you need help fast. If an
            offer says <b>day and night</b> you can reach someone at any time– no
            matter how late it is. You can also find offerings where you can receive
            help over the phone or online, if that’s what you prefer.
          question: How can I find help fast in case of an emergency?
        question_5:
          anchor: how_to_find_right_help
          answer: |
            There are two ways of looking for help and support offerings:
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            If you know the word describing your problem or the help you need, then
            enter the search term in the search field where it says <b>What?</b> on
            the main page. In the search field where it says <b>Where?</b> you can
            enter a location. You can also click on the word <b>Where?</b> first and
            then on the tab <b>Use my location</b>. Then click on the magnifying
            glass and press Enter. You will be shown offerings in your area!
            </li>
            <li>
            If you don’t know the exact word describing your problem you can try
            searching our categories. If, for example, you’re having trouble with
            your homework, you can click on the book. On the left side you will see
            a selection of terms on the topics of learning and working. Pick one.
            Enter a location in the field that says <b>Where?</b> You can also click
            on the word <b>Where?</b> and then on <b>Use my location</b>. Then click
            on the magnifying glass and press Enter. You will be shown offerings in
            your area!
            </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          question: How can I find the right kind of help?
        question_6:
          answer: |
            Many of the offerings that you will find on clarat are free of charge.
            However there are also offerings for which you have to pay. That doesn’t
            necessarily mean that you will have to pay for them yourself. Sometimes
            health insurance or a public service covers the costs. The best option
            is always to ask the organization directly. That way you can make sure
            the offer is free of charge for you or not.
          question: Will I find help that is free of charge?
        question_7:
          answer: |
            Some of the offerings you will find on clarat can be used anonymously.
            That means that you don’t need to tell anyone your name. If an offering
            can be used anonymously, this will be stated under <i>What do you have
            to do?</i> If it is not mentioned there, it is best to ask the
            organization directly.
          question: Will I find help where I can stay anonymous?
        question_8:
          answer: |
            As a child or adolescent, you can find help and support offerings if
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            you have a mental illness, meaning if you are suffering from
            psychological or emotional problems.
            </li>
            <li>
            you have a parent with a disability, regardless of whether they have a
            mental or physical disability.
            </li>
            <li>
            you have a brother or sister with a disability, regardless of whether
            they have a mental or physical disability.
            </li>
            </ul>

        question_9:
          answer: |

            how you can find the right kind of help, you can read about that
            %{ref_to_how_to_find_right_help}. If you are on the results page you
            will see the button <b>Show search options</b>. If you click on it you
            will see different filters from which you may choose to narrow down your
            search.

        heading: Do you have questions about the language used on clarat?
        question_1:
          answer: |
            Every person looking for help on clarat should be able to find it
            easily. That’s why clarat developed its own language. clarat’s language
            is easy to understand because it is based on the rules of plain
            language. clarat is for everyone and should be understood by everyone:
            by children, adolescents, and families; by people from different
            countries, those who were born here, and those who have just arrived in
            Germany; by those who speak German well and those who don’t.
          question: Why does clarat use simple language?
        question_2:
          answer: |
            On clarat you can find offerings for children, adolescents, and families
            of all sexual orientations. That means for lesbians, gays, bisexuals,
            transsexuals, and intersexuals. However, we can’t always list all of
            these terms since we want our descriptions to be short and easy to
            understand. That’s why we use the abbreviation LGBTI.
          question: Why does clarat use the abbreviation <i>LGBTI</i>?
        question_3:
          answer: |
            At clarat we use simple language. That’s why we use words that are easy
            to understand and that many people are familiar with. We also try to be
            as politically correct as possible. That’s why we usually use the word
            migrants instead of the term foreigners or an expression like <i>people
            with a migration background</i>.
          question: Why does clarat use the term <i>migrants</i>?
        question_4:
          answer: |
            On clarat we want everyone to quickly understand who is meant. Since
            most people use the term refugees, so do we, even though displaced
            persons might be more accurate. On clarat we try to be as accurate as
            possible, but it is more important to us that people understand
            everything quickly. That way everyone looking for help and support can
            find it even quicker.

        heading: Do you have questions about using clarat in different languages?
        question_1:
          anchor: how_many_languages
          answer: |
            You can read all of clarat’s pages in German and English.
          question: Which languages are available on clarat?
        question_2:
          answer: |
            You can select your language at the top of the page. Google Translate
            will then automatically translate everything into your language. Since
            it’s an automatic translation, there might be a few mistakes. The
            translation could thus sound a bit strange.
          question: How can I use clarat in my language?
        question_3:
          answer: |
            Google Translate generates automatic translations, which is why there
            might be a few mistakes. This means that the translation might not
            always be entirely correct.
          question: Why do the texts sound so strange in my language?
      section_5:
        heading: Do you have questions regarding your organization?
        question_1:
          answer: |
            Your organization offers help to children, adolescents, and families.
            That’s why we’ve included your offerings on <b>clarat family</b>. We
            want to enable those in need to find your help and support offerings as
            fast and as easily as possible.
            <br>
            Or your organization’s offerings provide help for refugees, who have
            fled to Germany. That’s why we’ve included them on <b>clarat
            refugees</b>. We want to give refugees quick and simple information on
            where they can find the help they need.
          question: Why are my organization’s offerings on clarat?
        question_2:
          answer: |
            <b>clarat family</b> helps children, adolescents, and families find your
            organization’s offerings. <b>clarat refugees</b> helps refugees find the
            support they need. Your organization’s offerings can only be found if
            people know about your organization. To make sure that everybody really
            understands the kind of help your organization provides, we explain
            everything in plain language. In addition to that, all offerings can be
            automatically translated into a variety of languages.
          question: What does clarat do for my organization?
        question_3:
          answer: |
            You can enter the name of your organization in the search field where it
            says <b>What?</b> and its location in the search field that says
            <b>Where?</b> You will then be shown a list of offerings provided in
            that location. If your organization is based in more than one location
            in Berlin, just enter Berlin in the search field where it says <b>Where?</b>
          question: How can I find my organization’s offerings on clarat?
        question_4:
          answer: |
            All offerings on clarat are written in simple language so that everyone
            can easily find help. Using simple language means that complicated
            things need to be simplified. Doing this also ensures that the automatic
            translation is much better. If you think that something should be
            explained differently, please let us know by sending an e-mail to
            %{mailto_clarat}.

          question: Why do the descriptions of our offerings on clarat differ from the ones we have on our website?
        question_5:
          answer: |
            We want to make it possible for anyone to search for help as easily as
            possible. That’s why we split up your organization’s offerings so that
            there is just one offering for each specific problem. That way people
            searching for help can find exactly the help they need.
          question: Why does one of my organization’s offering turn into several offerings on clarat?
        question_6:
          answer: |
            There are many help and support offerings for children, adolescents,
            families, and refugees in Germany. Since clarat is still under
            construction, it is possible that we have not yet been able to include
            all of your organization’s offerings on clarat, or we may have decided
            that not all of your organization’s offerings can be included on clarat
            at this time. on <b>clarat family</b> you can only find:
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            offerings that help people with problems
            </li>
            <li>
            for-cost offerings provided by charitable organizations
            </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            You will not find any offerings that solely provide medical help.
            </p>
            On <b>clarat refugees</b> you will currently not find:
            <p>

            <li>

            There are two possible reasons for that:
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            It could be that we haven’t started compiling information about
            offerings at your organization’s location. clarat is being developed
            gradually. It is thus possible that we haven’t had a chance to include
            your organization yet.
            </li>
            <li>
            It is also possible that your organization’s offerings don’t match our
            criteria. clarat only includes offerings on very specific topics. You
            can find out what those topics are %{ref_to_who_finds_help}. If you want

        (www.benckiser-stiftung.org). With the Benckiser Foundation, we have
        been supporting effective projects in the area of child and youth
        welfare for many years. In our work we kept noticing that it can be very
        difficult to find out what kind of help is out there. Then we realized
        that if we, the “experts”, can’t even get an overview of the help
        available out there, how difficult must it be for children, adolescents,
        and their families who are in actual need of help? Or for refugees who
        don’t know their way around yet? The answer: Very difficult! And that is
        how the idea for clarat came about: To find help easily. For families on
        clarat family. And for refugees on clarat refugees.

          Cookies sind kleine Text-Dateien, die auf Ihrer Festplatte gespeichert
          werden können, wenn Sie eine Webseite besuchen. Diese Text-Dateien
          werden von dem Web-Server, den Sie zur Herstellung einer Verbindung
          mit Hilfe Ihres Web-Browsers (z.B. Internet Explorer) verwendet
          haben, erzeugt und an Sie versendet. Auch wir verwenden Cookies,
          hauptsächlich um die Verwendung unserer Webseite zu erleichtern, etwa
          um den zuletzt von Ihnen nachgesuchten Standort für Sie zu speichern.
          Zu diesem Zweck verwenden wir u.a. sog. „Session-Cookies“, die nur
          während der Dauer ihres Besuches auf der Webseite funktionieren und
          nur solange Ihr Browser geöffnet ist. Sobald Sie die entsprechende
          Web-Session oder den Browser schließen, wird das Cookie automatisch
          gelöscht. Davon ausgenommen sind die Informationen über den von Ihnen
          zuletzt nachgesuchten Standort; diese werden nach Ablauf von drei
          Monaten automatisch gelöscht.

          sie Cookies automatisch akzeptieren. Sie können jedoch das Speichern
          von Cookies deaktivieren oder Ihren Browser so einstellen, dass er sie
          benachrichtigt, sobald Cookies gesendet werden. Außerdem können Sie
          Cookies auch jederzeit von Ihrem Rechner löschen (z.B: im Windows
          Explorer). Wenn Sie dies tun möchten, verwenden Sie bitte die
          Hilfe-Funktion Ihres Web-Browser bzw. Ihres Betriebssystems. Wir
          möchten Sie jedoch darauf hinweisen, dass Sie dadurch die
          Funktionsfähigkeit dieser Webseite beeinträchtigen können.
